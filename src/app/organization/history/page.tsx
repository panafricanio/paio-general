          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-gray-900">History of the Establishment of the Pan African Informatics Olympiad (PAIO)</h1>

            <p className="mb-6">
              The idea of creating a continental Informatics competition for Africa emerged from the collective efforts of several individuals deeply committed to advancing computer science education across the continent. Among the earliest contributors were José Esperazano, Hirwa Arnold, and Joel Lee, each of whom played a distinct and essential role in the foundation of PAIO.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Early Foundations</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              José Esperazano initiated the vision that would ultimately lead to the establishment of the Rwanda Informatics Olympiad (RwIO). Together with Kagaba Etienne, they supported many of the early activities that built the foundation for Informatics education and competitive programming in Rwanda. They were later joined by Hirwa Arnold, who focused on strengthening the academic structure of the program and developing a network of skilled Informatics coaches, laying the groundwork for long-term sustainability.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              As the initiative expanded, Joel Lee joined the RwIO team and provided crucial support that helped coaches become well-connected and more productive, ultimately making RwIO a reality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Expansion and Continental Vision</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The aspiration to establish a Pan-African Informatics Olympiad existed from the early stages, but its realization accelerated with the involvement of Joel Lee, who played a pivotal operational role in turning the continental idea into a concrete project.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              During IOI 2024, Joel served as Rwanda's first Observer, facilitating key connections among African team leaders. His efforts formed the initial network that would later become central to PAIO's creation. He also brought together experienced global professionals to form the International Scientific Committee (ISC) and collaborated with the Rwanda Informatics Team to establish the Host Committee (HC) and Technical Committee (TC).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The Rwanda Informatics initiative also benefited from the support of the Rwanda Math Olympiad team, particularly Arun Shanmugathan, who shared valuable organizational experience from the Pan African Mathematics Olympiad, helping shape the structure of PAIO.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Connections from NAOI 2025</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              PAIO also benefited from early connections formed during the first North African Olympiad in Informatics (NAOI), held on 19 April 2025. Hirwa attended as Team Leader of Rwanda which participated as a guest, where he gained practical experience and built relationships with organizers and leaders across Africa. Among them was Raouf Ould Ali, one of the NAOI organizers, who later provided important insights and guidance toward the organization of the first PAIO.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              These connections further strengthened the continental collaboration that made PAIO possible.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Strengthening Regional Collaboration</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              In July 2025, Hirwa Arnold served as Rwanda's Team Leader at IOI 2025. Together with Joel Lee, they reinforced relationships among African leaders and strengthened coordination between the ISC and participating countries. This work laid the final structural foundation necessary for a successful inaugural PAIO.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Contributions of Rwanda Olympiad Coaches</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The establishment of PAIO also relied heavily on the dedication of Rwanda's Olympiad coaches.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Jean Paul Elissa played a crucial role by developing the official PAIO 2025 website.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Norbert Ndayisenga and Kagaba Etienne contributed significantly to local organization and logistics.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The entire coaching team worked diligently in proctoring, preparing contest environments, and ensuring transparency and effectiveness throughout the event.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Their collective effort ensured that the first PAIO met international standards.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The First PAIO</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The first Pan African Informatics Olympiad (PAIO) took place 12–16 September 2025, hosted by Rwanda in an online format. This historic event marked the beginning of a continental initiative to promote excellence in Informatics across Africa.
